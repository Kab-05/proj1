# Binary Love: 1 or 1?
_A Valentine’s Day Website That Won’t Take "No" for an Answer_

## About This Project
Binary Love is an interactive web experience built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to make saying “No” impossible.

- Implemented using JavaScript event listeners, the button dynamically shakes and triggers visual elements when hovered.
- Hovering over "No" spawns animated evil face emojis using DOM manipulation and CSS keyframe animations.
- Clicking "Yes" triggers confetti animations and background music using external libraries.
- Fully deployed via GitHub Pages, requiring no backend, making it accessible on any browser.

This project leverages event-driven programming, DOM manipulation, and CSS animations to create an engaging, gamified user experience.
